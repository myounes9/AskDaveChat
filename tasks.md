Develop a dashboard to visualize key metrics (number of interactions, lead conversion rate, average conversation duration, etc.).

Scalability & Reliability:

Design the system to handle variable traffic loads.

Implement error handling and fallback mechanisms to ensure continuous operation even if third-party APIs experience outages.

8. Use Cases
Use Case 1: Visitor Engagement & FAQs
Primary Actor: Website Visitor

Description:
A visitor lands on the website and is automatically greeted by the chatbot. The chatbot asks if the visitor needs help and offers to answer frequently asked questions. The user can ask for information about services, pricing, or product details.

Outcomes:
The visitor receives immediate, accurate responses, leading to increased satisfaction and higher likelihood of engaging further with the site.

Use Case 2: Lead Capture & Qualification
Primary Actor: Prospective Customer

Description:
During the conversation, the chatbot recognizes intent to learn more about the offerings. It then prompts the visitor to provide their contact details in exchange for tailored information or a free consultation. Follow-up qualification questions (e.g., timeframe, budget) help determine lead quality.

Outcomes:
The chatbot captures essential lead information and qualifies the visitor, automatically feeding the data into the client's CRM for sales follow-up.

Use Case 3: Personalized Product or Service Guidance
Primary Actor: User Seeking Guidance

Description:
The visitor inquires about which product or service might be best suited for their needs. The chatbot uses a guided questionnaire style to understand the visitor's requirements and then offers tailored recommendations with explanations.

Outcomes:
The lead receives personalized product/service advice, enhancing engagement, driving interest, and increasing the likelihood of conversion.

Use Case 4: Escalation to Human Agent
Primary Actor: Visitor with Complex Queries

Description:
If the chatbot detects that a visitor's inquiry is beyond its programmed knowledge or if the user requests human assistance, the system either escalates the conversation in real time (e.g., triggers a notification to a human agent) or seamlessly provides a contact option for further support.

Outcomes:
Ensures no visitor feels unsupported, thereby reducing bounce rates and enhancing customer service by providing a smooth transition to human support.

Use Case 5: Engagement Analytics & Reporting
Primary Actor: Marketing/Sales Team

Description:
The client needs to review data on chatbot interactions and lead conversion metrics. The back-end system collects and logs user interactions, which are then visualized on a custom dashboard.

Outcomes:
Stakeholders can monitor performance, analyze user behavior, and adjust marketing strategies based on concrete data.

9. Success Metrics
Lead Conversion Rate: Percentage of interactions converting to valid leads.

Engagement Rate: Number of chats initiated vs. total website visitors.

User Satisfaction: Feedback scores and post-interaction surveys.

Response Accuracy: Rate of correctly answered queries based on predefined FAQs.

Operational Uptime: Maintaining a high level of system availability and responsiveness.

### Completed / Ongoing Tasks

*   **Branding Update:** Replaced instances of "LeadSpark" with "DawsBot" in UI components (`DashboardLayout`, `Dashboard` page). - **Done**
*   **Conversations Page:** Connected to Supabase `conversations` table (displays ID, Start Time, Visitor Email). Removed mock data. - **Done (Basic)**
*   [x] **Lead Capture (Function Calling):** - **In Progress**
    *   Created `leads`

- Read `src/services/settings-service.ts` to understand how `widgetSettings` (including `themeColor`) are loaded.
  - Identified that settings are loaded from `localStorage` (`chatbot_settings` key) and the default `themeColor` is `#10b981`.
  - Conclusion: Initial thought was `localStorage` value was white, but user confirmed it was red.
  - **Correction:** Realized the code was incorrectly using `hsl()` wrapper around the hex color value from settings when applying background color via inline styles.
  - **Fix:** Modified `ChatWidget.tsx` to use a CSS variable (`--theme-color`) set by the hex value from settings and apply it directly via `style={{ backgroundColor: 'var(--theme-color)' }}` to the header and minimized button. Added `as React.CSSProperties` to resolve TS errors.

- [ ] Implement Lead Capture Buttons (`lead_capture_contact`, `lead_capture_sample`)
  - [x] Add new conversation modes (`LEAD_CAPTURE_CONTACT_FORM`, `LEAD_CAPTURE_SAMPLE_FORM`)
  - [x] Add state variables for form inputs (name, email, phone, address)
  - [x] Update `handleResourceSelect` to transition to new modes
  - [x] Add JSX for lead capture forms in `renderChatInterface`
  - [x] Implement `handleLeadSubmit` function to validate, log event, and send lead details to backend assistant
